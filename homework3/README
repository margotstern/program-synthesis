Logic puzzle: Jack is looking at Anne. 
              Anne is looking at George. 
              Jack is married, George is not, and we donâ€™t know if Anne is married. 
              Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?
                          
Answer: Yes. If Anne is married, then she is married and looking at George, who is unmarried. 
             If Anne is unmarried, then Jack, who is married, is looking at her. Either way, the statement is correct.
             
Approach: 
- Create boolean variables to logically represent if a person is married or not for each person (J, A, G) and variable to encode married.
- Assert logical constaints defined in the problem: Jack is married, Geroge is not, Anne is looking at George, Jack is looking at Anne
- Assert that M is true, meaning a married peron looking at an unmarried person.
